# Web Design for Climate Data


## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this project a web dashboard was created using visualizations about weather characteristics. [Check it out!](https://kflores56.github.io/Climate-Analysis-Web-Design/)

Individual pages were created for each plot as well as a means by which one can navigate between them. The pages contain the visualizations and corresponding explanations. A page was also created where a comparison of all of the plots is shown and another page was created where all the data used to build the visualizations.

### Website Details

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* The [landing page](#landing-page) contains:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and the ability to click an image and be taken to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages](#visualization-pages), each contain:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The visualization for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* The [Comparisons page](#comparisons-page) contains:
  *  All of the visualizations on the same page so they can be easily compared.
* The [Data page](#data-page) contains:
  * A responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * The data came from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML with Pandas. 
* The [Navigation Bar](#navigation-menu) contains:
    * The Navigation bar includes a drop down menu of the visualizations. When the page is made smaller the entire navigation bar collapses into a drop down menu.

You'll build four of these, one for each visualization. Here's an example of one:
